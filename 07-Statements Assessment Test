Statements Assessment Test
Let's test your knowledge!

Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
#Code here
x = st.split()

for i in x:
  if i[0] == 's':
    print(i)
  else:
    continue

Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10. ANS: list(range(0,11,2))
ANS: for num in range(0,11,2)
print(num)

#Code Here
for i in range(0,10):
  if i % 2 == 0:
    print(f'Even number {i}')
  else:
    continue

Use a List Comprehension to create a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3.
ANS: list5 = [i for i in range(1,51) if i%3 ==0]

#Code in this cell
list5 = [i for i in range(1,50) if i%3 ==0]

[]
Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"

st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'
#Code in this cell
for i in x:
  if len(i)%2 ==0:
    print(i)

Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#Code in this cell ANS - range(1,101)

for i in range(1,100):
  if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
    print('FizzBuzz')
  elif i%5 ==0:
    print('Buzz')
  elif i%3 == 0:
    print('Fizz')
  else:
    print(i)
    
Use List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string below:

st = 'Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string'
#Code in this cell
st3 = [i[0] for i in ('Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string').split()]
print(st3)

Great Job!
